# Camille's Personal Website

I created this website in the summer of 2020. I started the summer with no web development experience. However, I had to pick it up quickly, as I was to become a summer immersion program instructor with Girls Who Code, and I needed to teach my students HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After learning the basics and playing around with a few smaller projects, I decided to work on a long-standing goal: to create my personal site!

I chose to write the project using Vue.js on the suggestion of a friend (who was the reason I considered making a portfolio site in the first place!). As this is my first project, there is still I have left to learn about Vue. I believe that there's functionality that I could take advantage of to greatly simplify some of the HTML, for example. But the site is a work in progress! I plan to update the page with life updates, of course, but I also want to refactor the code where possible! So check back with updates :)

## Running this website

Simply `cd` into the root directory of the project and run 

`yarn serve`

At least I hope this is what's required! Because I created this project before I had extensive software development experience, I didn't document the necessary steps thoroughly enough... so good luck! (I've learned so much since starting to work professionally in the technology sector.)
